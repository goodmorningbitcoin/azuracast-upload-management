   cd azuracast-upload-management
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```

3. **Edit your configuration:**
   Open `config.json` and replace the default values with your AzuraCast details and podcast feeds (see Configuration section below)

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` with your AzuraCast details and podcast feeds:

```json
{
  "azuraCast": {
    "host": "your-azuracast-domain.com",
    "stationId": 1,
    "defaultPlaylist": 1,
    "apiKey": "your-api-key-here"
  },
  "shows": [
    {
      "rssUrl": "https://feeds.example.com/podcast.rss",
      "maxEpisodes": 5,
      "maxAgeDays": 30,
      "playlistId": 1,
      "enabled": true
    }
  ]
}
```

### Configuration Options

#### Show Settings

- **`maxAgeDays`** - Maximum age in days for episodes (default: 30) 
- **`playlistId`** - Playlist to assign episodes to

## Getting Your API Key

4. Copy the generated key to your `config.json`

## Usage

```

### Development Mode (no memory optimization)

```

### Check Syntax
```bash
npm test
```

### Automated Runs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"API request failed"**
- Check your AzuraCast host and API key
- Ensure your AzuraCast instance is accessible
- Verify station ID is correct

**"Download failed"** 
- Check RSS feed URLs are accessible
- Verify episode enclosure URLs are valid
- Check network connectivity

**"Large file detected"**
- The script automatically handles large files
- Use `npm start` which allocates extra memory
- Files over 200MB will show warnings but should work

**"form-data module required"**
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Ensure `form-data` package is installed

### Logs

Check `podcast-uploader.log` for detailed operation logs:
```bash
tail -f podcast-uploader.log
```

## Security Notes

- **Keep your API keys secure** - Don't share your configured `config.json` publicly
- Replace all default values in `config.json` with your real details
- Use environment variables for production deployments
- Regularly rotate your API keys
